## Introduction

**nf-core/rnaseqpipeline** is a bioinformatics pipeline that performs RNA-Seq data analysis, from raw sequencing reads to gene expression quantification.

The pipeline ingests raw sequencing data in FASTQ format and processes it through several key steps, including quality control, read alignment, and transcript quantification. The final output includes gene expression counts and quality reports.

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and adheres to the [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) community guidelines, ensuring high standards of reproducibility, scalability, and portability across different computing environments.

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

<!-- TODO nf-core: Describe the minimum required steps to execute the pipeline, e.g. how to prepare samplesheets.
     Explain what rows and columns represent. For instance (please edit as appropriate):

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2
CONTROL_REP1,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz
```

Each row represents a fastq file (single-end) or a pair of fastq files (paired end).

-->

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

<!-- TODO nf-core: update the following command to include all required parameters for a minimal example -->

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/rnaseqpipeline \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

For more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/rnaseqpipeline/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/rnaseqpipeline/parameters).

## Pipeline output

To see the results of an example test run with a full size dataset refer to the [results](https://nf-co.re/rnaseqpipeline/results) tab on the nf-core website pipeline page.
For more details about the output files and reports, please refer to the
[output documentation](https://nf-co.re/rnaseqpipeline/output).

## Credits

nf-core/rnaseqpipeline was originally written by Mehdi Merbah and Nicolai Oswald as a replication of the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline.

We thank the nf-core community for their continuous support and contributions to the nf-core project and giving us a basis and the resources for developing this pipeline.
